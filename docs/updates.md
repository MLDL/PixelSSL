## Updates

- **[Sep 14 2019] A Bug in the Code of DeepLabV2 is Fixed.**  
  For semantic segmentation, a bug of ASPP module in DeepLabV2 code is fixed. The effect of this bug on the results is negligible. The new pre-trained model has been uploaded.


- **[Aug 13 2019] PixelSSL v0.1.0 is Published!**  
  v0.1.0 supports supervised-only learning, three semi-supervised learning algorithms 
  ([MT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01780), 
  [AdvSSL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07934), 
  [GCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05258)) 
  and one example task (semantic segmentation).
